** Reel Insight **

Reel insight is a personalised statistics based service that allows users to update recently watched films to discover stats about themselves based upon viewing habits.
The site is designed as a mobile first site, with functionality to view on a web browser.
Users have the option to log in, view their film history, and view a range of stats that are dynamically updated each time they add a new film.
Users also have the option to remove films they have added by accident (or no longer wish to render), this in turn updates the users stats page.

The website is hosted at https://reel-insight.netlify.app/home (
Please note the website may take around 30-60 seconds to load if the server hasn't been contacted in while - we would reccommend viewing on a mobile for the best experience)

This project was built using React, with Typescript and hosted on Netlify.
The project is run on a backend server we have created previously using MongoDB. The repository for this server can be found here https://github.com/Always-Serving-Code/be-film-stat-app
